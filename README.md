## Features
- **Decentralization**: The system operates on a decentralized network, ensuring no single point of failure and enhancing security.
- **Transparency**: All voting transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and auditability.
- **Security**: Utilizes cryptographic techniques to secure the integrity and confidentiality of votes.
- **Immutable Ledger**: The blockchain ledger ensures that once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered or tampered with.
- **Accessibility**: Enables voters to cast their votes remotely, enhancing accessibility and participation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-voting.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` and `cd frontend && npm i`
3. Start the application: `npm run dev`

## Usage 
1. Organizer can do registeration for voter by creating a unique digital identity.
2. Browse through available voting options and select your preferred choices.
3. Cast your vote securely using your digital identity.
4. Monitor the voting process in real-time and view the results after the voting period ends.

## Technologies Used
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Utilizes blockchain technology for decentralized consensus and immutability.
- **Smart Contracts using Solidity**: Implements smart contracts to automate voting processes and ensure execution without intermediaries.
- **Ethers.js**: Complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.
- **Frontend Framework**: Utilizes Next.js, Tailwind CSS for building the user interface.
- **Backend Framework**: Utilizes Pinata IPFS to store candidate and voter images
